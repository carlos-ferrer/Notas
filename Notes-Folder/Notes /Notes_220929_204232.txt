Why don't you hop inside my car
We'll sing a little tune
Don't go outside it's way too cold to be
Why can't you sleep here by my side
My hands feel very numb
Oh can you help me feel just a little more

Its 9pm woke up from a nap 
Turns out my day hasn't started yet 
Is it too late to make it right 
Is it too cold to live the night 

I know that life can oh so tough 
But i also know that so are you 
So lift your head up and start to fight 
I know you've got it in you to win this game
