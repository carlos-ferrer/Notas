Today the rain pours in my heart
She left at noon, I think it was
Though much too soon to fall apart
I could not bear to hide my flaws 

The garden's flowers bloom today
My mind began to softly cry
While flowers laugh in my dismay

Those summer days we spent apart
Abandoned me
Applause
My flaws
Ignore

A coffee grinder in my heart
A little lonely at the
