I noticed the rain today
I saw it bounce against my shoe
I saw it as clear as day
Dancing around the darkest clouds

My eyes cried a river for you
For you, my love are through with me
That's why I'm so blue
These days, the rain pours down on me

And I figured I should tell you
That I know the reason why
If I cry for missing you
Without you, oh without you, I die

The rain has just cleared away
A new found love came to me
But i was not ready to say
Come to me, come be my dear

The night fell across the sky
Wiping away the rays from the sun
I don't see a light in my life
I don't feel no love since you've been gone

And I had to come and tell you
That the reason for my blues 
Is because you stopped the singing
That my heart came to amuse
