(Verse)

Drive my car
Round the town
Find a bar
Put me down

Just a beer
And a smoke
Give me cheer
Till I'm broke

(Pre-Chorus)
This is my night out
This is my life now
Don't come to find me
This is my party

^ not happy with this

(Chorus) 
No one here can feel my pain
All my thoughts rebound
I'm lost in my brain
I've gone underground

Work my job
