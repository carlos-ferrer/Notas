He holds his arm up into the air
Another showman slipping off his mind
He who'll cry when those he lost
Turn down his wish to frown upon

The exquisite man with hands of straw
A hair of candles and of the utmost importance
His button eyes on top his head
He laughs! He cries! He shouts out loud

I am the man of Nothingland,
