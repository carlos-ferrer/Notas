It's a tale as old time,
someone opens a door
and they're frightened to find
some glimpse of their own past
ghastly shadows surrounding
an old photograph
Yet they soon settle in, lying then to begin

Softly speaking the time settles down
Fools around for a while then goes back to the start
Remember to think is to live and to live is to fear
everything that you did

I can't tell with precision what it is that your vision is trying to grasp
Lie in bed for an hour 'fore one comes to devour all the thoughts that lie deep in your head
