I feel like I planted the right seeds

i feel like I started something
great
that's gonna turn me into a better person

How I miss them
Omy
Its been what
Like 1 hour
I looked at the little keychain thingies they gave me
and started crying
because I was happy

for now im here
Alone in my room
Alone in my town
Which I'm starting to think is a
sadder place
and quieter
and lonelier
than hers
