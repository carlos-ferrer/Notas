Eighteen, always thought that I was special 
My mama told me I'd be shooting for the stars 
But at night when the moon shone bright
All I thought about was making ends meet

I sold my soul, sold my body away
Getting bitter after every passing day
What's the matter, can't you get enough sleep
Just take these pills that make living less bleak
