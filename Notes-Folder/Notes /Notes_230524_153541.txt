I'm missing things I'm used to having
Look through the mirror while I cut my hair
Shorter than it was
Fixing to go back

Times are ruthless, killing me
Slowly turning into a thing
That no one understands
Does anybody care

I see a shadow cast on my wall
A mirrored image sees no light at all
The lights begin to bend
And soon I'll see the end

All my friends tell me I'm fading
When everything just seems so draining
I hope someday it stops
Someday not far away

A little tune sings in my head
Some birdsong, maybe something else
Gives energy to me
While telling me to stay

When this is over I'll see myself
My shining eyes ought to be seeing
No darkness anymore
I hope that it pays off

My memories are slowly fleeing
