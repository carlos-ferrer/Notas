I felt a burning in my mind all night
Thought I would see you to relieve the pain
Cause when I'm with you I just feel alright
Was wondering if you ever felt the same

We're dancing 'round the ballroom floor tonight
I called you over just to play the game
Then we can spend some time in love, green light
We'll play around in bed to end the day

My love for you burns like a fire
Sounds kinda silly but it's true
I have a feeling that you get me
Like no one else does

Was hoping you'd be free at 9, my dear
You're all I ever think about these days
I'm always waiting for you to be near
Give me the word and I'll be gone or stay

We have been at it for a while, today
Would you be mine if I gave you the word
Just pent up pressure on my mind to say
We're friends with benefits or so I've heard
