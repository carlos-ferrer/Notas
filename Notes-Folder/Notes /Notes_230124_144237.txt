I don't believe in anything
I don't belong anywhere
I can't see you at all
Don't wanna hear your lies
Don't wanna see the end
If it's about to come then it's about to go

I can't afford to see my life turn into soot
I wish to see things the way they show themselves 
A little bit of positivity can't hurt 
They say to me as they try to stab my back

And everyday i look into your eyes to see
A hint of me, wish you could me be
