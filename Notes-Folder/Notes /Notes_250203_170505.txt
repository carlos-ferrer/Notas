I long for days where thoughts go numb
When nothing else can weigh my back
The weeds that slowly grip the mind
Shall once again demise in pain

And all the world's a soulless bond
With whom I might decide against 
To wander off into the sun
Expecting nothing in return

I gathered branches from a tree 
And ran away
