Give me something to believe in

Back to the start
Leading you back to the start

Its never too late to make your bad days change

Looking for light in the daek
And the water gets high

If you don't know where you are
So look for the light that is shining ahead
Leading you back to your heart

Back to the start

Hiphoppy
With cool funky feel
Electric guitar trumpets drums
