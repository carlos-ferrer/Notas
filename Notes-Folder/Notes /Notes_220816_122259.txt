I got a dry mouth beaten up looking out the window
My face turned red while yours turned blue
I didn't know what life meant but now I do
And all I wanna say is I love you

There's times my wallet seems heavy inside
It weighs me down, the junk i buy 
I guess it's probably cause it's made out of hide
I don't know, but all i wanna say is I feel blue
