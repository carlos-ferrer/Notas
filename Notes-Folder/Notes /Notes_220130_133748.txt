I feel the sunlight shining on my face
Another day begins and I'm feeling creeped out
By this little girl who lives next door
She likes to paint her own portraits of the neighborhood

No one comprehends her little fits of rage

Johnny with a mustache
Brenda on a stage 
No one understands her little fits of rage
Michael is a shy guy 
He likes it when it rains
