How many words do you want in your book
How many times do i gotta tell you
Cause every time i say it you don't listen
I swear it's almost like you don't understand

Doo doo doo
(I'm always saying it)
Doo doo doo
(you know it's true)
Dooo dooo doo
(I'll keep repeating)
Doo doo doo
(i love you)

I'm walking out the dog
These thoughts on my mind
Just tryna catch a breath
