Suzy is a girl who don't take nobody's shit
Refuses to go out with other girls to fool around
Her teachers tell her parents shes got something in her brain
They take her to see the psych who tells her she needs to take some meds
She's not a normal girl you see she doesn't like pink clothes
Too rebellious and progressive 

Her fate is to walk out the door
Can't be here anymore
You don't belong
