It's eating me inside
Rounded up another corner
They're full of love and pride
While the world is going under
Under the light
Everything looks clean

Bring your nanana tonight 
Mumble words into my ear
As the light was shining bright
And everyone was going under
Behind the lenses
Nothing is the same
