I see you pace around your room at night
Afraid of things you still don't know right now
The stars that tell your fate, they shed a light 
Upon the doubts that lie inside deep down

You say your eyes don't work as well as then

You gaze into my soul to see again
Lies deep beneath the sea wherein I fell
a scar
