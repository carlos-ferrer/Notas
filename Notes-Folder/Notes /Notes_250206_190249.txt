I've yet to understand how
she makes me feel
when the lights disappear she turns off
hiding her face in the mirror
the shadow that's cast of her eye
I'm drowning myself in her veil

when her arm reaches down for your soul
don't mind me I'm just biding my time
for her spurious rage disappears
holding onto sensations that freeze

she makes me cry
i cant understand why
holding my hand
far away from her heart

As your time goes she smiles in the cold
You reach out but you can't grasp her clothes
You're alone in a nightmare of hope
Her elusiveness reeks of disdain

empty thoughts grace your mind once again 
your delusions are free from her hand
they move out and disperse like balloons
hopeless beings of futures unknown 

she makes me die
her unattainable lie
holding my hand
far away from her mind

after all what I have is a dream
representing myself out of tune
and the bargain that's yours to absolve
disappears as you reach for her arm

my whole life is a symbol of dread
shapeless nonsense
