On her own
Things go south
She thinks too much and sticks to her past
Cause all her life
She made ends meet
Surviving day by day in endless dreaming

Now Laura's saying bye-bye 
She's going home to end her life
Won't wake up feeling older
Belonging to a group of shitfaced friends
Outside her room a street sign
With bloodstains reading "you're fine"
Announcing her defeat to the whole world

She goes away
Seeks her comfort in a bottle
Full of broken thoughts 
A laugh

Life is pain
She tells herself
And in the end it all amounts to nothing
A distant smile
A colder touch
Her hopelessness is coming to an end

She tells the nurse that she's fine
They take her to the psych ward
Shares her room with a single mother
Who forgot how to take care of her own kids
She leaves towards the sidewalk
The never ending cycle
Beginning once again without her will

She goes away
Seeks her comfort in a bottle
Full of broken thoughts 
A laugh
