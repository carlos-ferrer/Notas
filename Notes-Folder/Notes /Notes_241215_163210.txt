Some things are just never meant to be
That's what she said to me, that's what she said to me
I can't believe we're moving on
After the times we've had, after the times we had
We were running out of time 
and all the things we said, don't matter anymore
I hope someday you'll find the one
The one you're looking for, the one you're looking for
You are running out
All the things you can't remember now
I'm trying to remove myself from this whole town
But I'm not as prone to forgetting it all

And i go
I go back to wherever my heart takes me so
I'm going home and taking all my things with me
I'll try and write a song for you
I can never tell what we were all about
I think it's hard to revisit the past now
It's starting to become a little tiring
it's unwinding, undoing all things we used to do
I had to tell myself to stop loving you 
I could've sworn I saw your face come up again
But I'm trying to forget the pain
I need to get myself another home
Cause your heart could never fit another soul
You pretended to love me cause you hated being alone
