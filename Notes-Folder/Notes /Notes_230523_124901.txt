It's been the talk of the town 
Ooh oh
They were laughing out loud
Ooh oh 
All the children have drowned
Ooh noo

He was looking for peace
Peace inside of his mind
But he found what he feared

They were having it out 
Right inside the saloon 
Everybody could hear

When he pulled out the gun
Something happened inside 
A crowd forming around 

He ran away from his fate 
Wanted dead or alive
