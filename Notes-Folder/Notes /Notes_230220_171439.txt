I look in the mirror only for to see
A shape that i don't recognize
From which I'm trying to escape
When I get up each day I feel a weight
Upon my back that I can't stand
Its only fair to let it go

Now all the seasons feel so far apart
My time, it seems to slowly stop
Until I'm frozen in my place
I try to fight it off my mind
I seem to fail every time
A wall emerges 'round my bed

From where I stand I cannot see the light 
They talk about all of the time
