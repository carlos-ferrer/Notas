Love, love, lalalala
Love love, lalalala
You know it's true
Yeah, I want you
So won't you please 
Love, love, lalalala
Love love, lalalala
You know I want it
And so do you
So I'll tell you what we're gonna do

We'll leave today
Let's drive away
To a place where our love can be forever

Put on your shoes 
We'll shake these blues
In a way
