Verse 1:
I walked down the road, with my head held low
Thinking of the times, that we used to know
The wind blew cold, as the leaves fell down
I knew my love, was no longer around

Chorus:
Oh, where did you go, my sweet love of mine
I'm searching high and low, but you're nowhere to be found
I'll keep on walking, till the end of time
Hoping one day, you'll be back by my side

Verse 2:
I sat by the river and I watched water flow
Thinking of the promises we used to know
The sun set slow, as the birds sang their song
I knew my heart, was where it belonged

Chorus:
Oh, where did you go, my sweet love of mine
I'm searching high and low, but you're nowhere to be found
I'll keep on walking, till the end of time
Hoping one day, you'll be back by my side

Outro:
I'll keep on walking, till the end of time
Hoping one day, you'll be back by my side
