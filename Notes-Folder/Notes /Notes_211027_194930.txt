You left a beautiful mark in me
You left a beautiful mark in me

My soul writes songs so you can understand
It doesn't know any right or wrong 
Whether it rained or not, it's not my fault
Maybe we should've stayed back on your place 
Everything was easy when you

left those beautiful marks on me
You left those beautiful marks on me
