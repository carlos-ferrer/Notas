She said she thought I was more of a friend
I couldn't keep my eyes from watering
You know I really thought we had a thing

The day I met her my heart was racing fast
Thought I had found someone special at last 
Guess I was 

There was this time she caught me with a ring
Asked me what was wrong I said nothing
Hid it away in the drawer of my desk
