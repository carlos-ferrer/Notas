Staring at the white non sense
That permeates my mind
I'm strictly forbidden to uphold
Any semblance of significance
Any darker shade of gray

From this mirror I see nothing
I am aiming at the spotlight
Which has never made much sense
Will I ever wander off the path
And see myself anew

Listen close 
 you might just hear
the sounds of my defeat
crumbling slowly to the ground 
with no parachute around
