An old broken down television had the weather on
At the time that it happened I wasn't one
To worry about it all
Soon another one might find that it isn't right
To push people down on your way to getting up
Or so they say 
My mom used to tell me son you better think things through 
Or you'll find that someone else might do
Break into your heart
