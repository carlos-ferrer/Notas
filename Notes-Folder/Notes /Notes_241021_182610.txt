Never mind the stress that we endured
I feel that we'll remember this
The hopeful daze of longing now breaks in
Swapped in for all the times we had

You called me late at night to say
You're sorry for the things you've done
I see your face lit up on the little screen
Your smiling eyes, they break my mind

And at times 
I catch myself daydreaming, lost in thought
It's been years 
I must have been asleep for all this time

I always thought that life was like a boat
On an empty ocean far from land
You row and row and never move an inch
But you came in and proved me wrong 

Nothing would come between us both 
We told each other every day
Two souls united by a bond
How foolish and naive I've been

And at times
I catch myself wondering about the past
How different
Could we both have turned out

Had we never met
Had we never shared a thought

break or something 
repeat chorus twice whatever
