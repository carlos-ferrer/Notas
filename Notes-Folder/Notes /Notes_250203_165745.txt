Dear old Paul he's got it rough
Rents a dorm just out of town
Wears a saddened pair or shoes
And gives the door a silent stare

Expecting nothing he soon finds
He winches thoughts that weigh the mind
And hopeless longs for his demise
Strides along the empty house

Upset with all the world's disdain
Compromises with the devil
To be someone without a soul
As he breaks near his final goal
