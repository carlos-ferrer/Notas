I deleted all your angry texts
So it looks like you still love me

I've been chasing for that high
When I fell in love with you

But when it all comes crashing down
I still end up dreaming of you

A nightmare soon to end
A love to grow anew
If only I had know
You'd do this shit again
and again and again and again
