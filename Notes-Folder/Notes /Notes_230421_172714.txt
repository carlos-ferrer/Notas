Look up just this once
Aim at the sky
And watch as the circle of light surrenders
To a battalion of eyes which gaze upon it 
Your plans have now foiled 
Your dreams went away 
Wake up again to the same boring day 

Look up one more time 
Aim at the heart 
And watch as it beats to the old tailor's song 
An army of people are fleeing from it
Their faces are bending
With secrets uncovered
Never mind what they suffered
