I don't wanna wake up 
I don't wanna see the end
As much as people tell me
I am not one to pretend

The girl I saw the other night
I asked her for some blow
Her nose was stitched together
On some doctor's bungalow

Now wait here for a minute
While I take your time away
I come back with some water
And a poignant little flame 

The years go by so fast 
Things that change are still the same 
My parents who don't trust me 
Labeled me the family's shame 

I wish I could stop living 
But i have a fear of death 
So while I keep on going 
I'll be smoking crystal meth
