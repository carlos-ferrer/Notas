The man with the flaming moustache

From the golden coasts of california
Hails the subject of this song
He has no money, charm, nor love or hate
The people say he has bad taste

But among the unfamiliar people 
He shared his abode with 
He's a leader and a communist
The sort of guy that you can trust
Don't pay no mind to his appearance

He's the man with the flaming moustache
