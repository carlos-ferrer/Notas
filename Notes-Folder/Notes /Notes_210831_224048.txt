i can never be too happy
euphoria always slips away
i cried myself to sleep last night

it seems I never get it
death awaits me in the end
i lie in bed and think about life 

but there's a light near the end of the tunnel
shining bright near the end of my life
it calls me to wake from the dream
to live
