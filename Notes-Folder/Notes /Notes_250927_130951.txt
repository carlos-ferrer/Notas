How come you're still around
I'm no good after all
You're just desperate for love
And I'll give you my all

I'll be holding your hand 
You can try to pretend 
That I'll care for you too
And everything that I do
Will be for us

You've got tricks up your sleeve
But I know you won't leave
Cause you've got no one else
I made sure you're alone
It's just you and me

We'll always be together
Forever and ever
You just know that it's true
Nobody in between 
It's just us two

You can try to deny
But you know that you're mine
And you've got no idea
Where to go
You'll stay here
