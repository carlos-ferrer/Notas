Let's go, I'll show you 'round
I don't know, but we'll find out
If our love speaks loud, we're going round
Around the town now, we're goin wild

I'm feeling fine I have to say
I'm gonna dance around the world
My darling love came to me today 
She's the one for me, yeah she's my girl

She asked me once if our love would last
She's worried that this love might hurt 
I told her not to worry about the past
So i sang these words to encourage her 

I don't know, but let's find out
If our love speaks loud, we're going around
around the town now, we're goin wild
Cause this is it, baby, you know it's true

We had a guy come over to us
At the diner table, we were chatting about
How'd you score a girl like this
I looked in his eyes and this is what I said

I don't know, I guess I'm lucky 
I asked her out, and she said okay
She smiled and stood tall and proud
"We're in love, and that's what it's all about"
