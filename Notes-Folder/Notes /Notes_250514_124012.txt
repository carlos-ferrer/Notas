All the times I tried so hard
To be someone everyone will like
But in the end I'm just not cut out for this

I look inside the mirror gazing back at me
I find all the terror hiding behind
my soul resides

Many times I look at me in the mirror
and i find all the terrors hiding behind
my soul inside

and all the time i tried so hard
to he a person that everyone will like
But in the end im just not cut out for this

and i go outside
i look into the mirror and i hate my town
I took a little dump it took a little tine
i never would've thought i had a go
