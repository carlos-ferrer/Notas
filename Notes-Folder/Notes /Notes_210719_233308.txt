I never thought it would go like this
No it never occurred to me at all
I never thought it would it would be this way
Oh wo owowowwoo

Come back to me i

Oh since I met you my life's been turned upside down
But you don't care so you beat me to the ground
You act so cool with your friends messing around
I know the secrets you're so keen to hide from town
