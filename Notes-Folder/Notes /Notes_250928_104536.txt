Sleeping man on bus

Nike Hoodie
Blue Jeans
Burgundy shoes
White socks
Camouflage backpack
Swollen eyes
Short hair
Patchy beard

Yawn
Briefly wakes up and looks aroumd 
Closes eyes 

Far from wherever he's going - feels comfortable sleeping on the bus

Right foot slightly elevated from floor

Right arm leaning against window

Where's he going? 
What was his day like 
Was he working? 

His resting face suggests annoyance 
He's not just tired
He's exhausted - work 
16:47

Why the backpack? 
There doesn't seem to be much inside of it

Mouth half open now

Head leaning against window 
Head tilted down slightly

He's passed out
