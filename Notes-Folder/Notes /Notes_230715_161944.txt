I tricked myself into opening my heart
I think I shoulda known this right from the start
Her hair shone bright as the nightly stars went by
At the coffee shop I used to go to pry

Into the life of strangers, try 
To maybe learn a thing or two
And I'll I wanted you to say 
I love you
But don't you tell me what to do
