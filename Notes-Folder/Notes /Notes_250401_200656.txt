Hey, tell me your name
Tell me what's your favorite spot to hide from the whole world
and the things you've done to keep yourself aligned to who you are
outside your inner core

Say that one more time
What do you think of all the happiness we hold inside
Or the indifference some people keep so close to their heart 
The contempt breaks us apart
