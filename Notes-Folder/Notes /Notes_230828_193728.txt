I bought myself a mirror
On which I intend to stare
To leave behind the many times
I was afraid to look you straight in the eyes

I don't feel as courageous
As one might think that I am
I have far too many fears
To synthesize into this simple song I wrote

And though I'm tackling them
One at a time I just can't tell
If little lonely me is capable
Of signing off this life knowing I've lived
