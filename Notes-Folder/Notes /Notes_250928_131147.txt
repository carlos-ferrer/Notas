A pile of clothes stares at him
Though he doesn't really seem to care
Been looking at his phone for hours
There's really nothing much to do

He wonders why he sits alone
Nobody else gives him their time
The wires hanging around his roof
Start coming down as to invite him

His fridge is empty for today 
Won't get his pay until tomorrow
The cars outside calls for his name
Each time one passes by his house

He's gotten tired of it all
Won't answer any of your calls 
He pulls the trigger in his hand 
But nothing happens to him again
