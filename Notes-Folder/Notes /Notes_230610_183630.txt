One month ago in your arms
I couldn't feel my legs but
It didn't matter anyway

That's when you looked in my eyes
And told me you'd never go
And like a fool i believed in you

Except I don't feel the obligation 
To engage in conversation 
With you anymore
You said don't feel sorry 
So i told an allegory
