I saw a doctor kneading smiles
His gentle hands pushing aside
The sadness in his patients lonely eyes
With some unusual technique
He worked his way around their brain
Hoping to disarm the bomb inside

Down by the fifth street there's a man
Who sells his life away for fame
The passersby all think he's quite insane
And all his customers admit
They have a tendency for vice
But they'll gladly take their time for such a price

As for the outcasts out of town
Working their way into the game
They feel different but they want to be the same
As everyone else in this place,
Their selfish lives, their hurried pace
They don't have the time to listen to your case

"One day I hope I get to leave"
A lonely housewife thinks out loud
What her husband doesn't want to talk about
Their windows watch as they debate
Her disappointing lack of faith
Just another patient lined up at the gate
