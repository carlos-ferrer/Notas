Oh, mister travesty
I sure have missed you
Its been a long long time
But i can't help but think of seeing you

Oh dear old Dylan
Will you sing a song for me
I've been a-thinking
Bout some things i shouldn't be

Remind me to call you
When I'm feeling down
Remind me to call you
When I do skip town

I'm just a traveler 
Fixing to see
A world in better shape
To leave it to my family 

I stand alone at night 
Drinking my beer
Just waiting for the time
When I can leave for work

Remind me to call you 
When I'm feeling down
Remind me to call you
When I go downtown
