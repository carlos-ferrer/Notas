I've got many words to say
Would you stay here by my side
Till the end of times
You and I are more like one
We're linked together through our hearts 
We both know why

All I want is more of you
So I can rest my thoughts alright
You know it's true
You're the sun, the moon, the stars
A constellation for me to gaze
For all my life

I am nothing without you
