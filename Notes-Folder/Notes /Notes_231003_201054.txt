I won't lie I've thought about doing some things with you
Things that I would never do
With anyone else but you

Well maybe I have a couple things or two before you came
But that's because I never knew
That I wanted you all my life

I'll list the things I wanna do before you start to think
That I'm a total creep
Or something to that effect

I wanna go hang out and have a large bowl of açaí
I wonder if you ever heard
About this fancy treat from Brazil

At least that's where I think it's from, it might be Uruguay
You see I'm not that clever
But I always try my best to impress
