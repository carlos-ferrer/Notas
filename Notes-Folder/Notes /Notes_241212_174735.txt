I've been overthinking about the past and present
Worrying about everything that's soon to happen
Maybe it won't happen but I'll still be thinking
Part of me believes that it's a healthy habit
Don't know what to say about the crippling sadness
Will someone put a stop to this endless hurting
I cannot believe my life is gone at thirty
Fix it bit by bit by talking all things over
Friends that come and go are necessary sorrows
Wish to be alone in this unending madness
But happen to be human and to crave attention
Sometimes it just hurts to go and speak my mind
All the happy stories in the end are faking
Bottling emotions that deserve releasing
Turning things around in my own little ocean
Full of waves and storms that never stop resurging

When you were a young boy who just wanted toys and
Stood in front a store that had your favorite one
But things come at cost is what yours parents told you
Nothing had prepared you for the actual hurting
Living is impossible when you're alone and
Crying all the time isn't as easy as to
Go out and compose a verse or two of love
And dedicate it to another fleeting dove
Who'll never stay beside you one way or another
Sometimes the best gift you have is your own company
I told everyone I was going the mall and
Buy the old remote control i wanted as a
Kid but when i got i felt empty inside
Nothing would prepare me for the terrors of life
Maybe if I die I'll be reborn a star
and never have to worry bout making it far
I'll be just where I wanna be and live with freedom
Enjoy all of live's burning sickly pleasures
