I got your picture on the phone
A happy smile that I lean on
It's all I need to be back home
Leave me where I'm supposed to be
I've traveled far, can't wait to see
the difference all my walking has done

My sanity is slowly leaving me
behind a blackened curtain see
those eyes, they're peering back at me
And if your longing can't compose
I'm sorry love I'm so verbose 
I'm trying to remember what you said
One day before I left this town
to test the waters that abound 
'fore destiny took over you and me
